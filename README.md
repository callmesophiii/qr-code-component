## Overview
This project features a responsive QR Code card using HTML and CSS, intended to help developers practice layout, typography and component styling.

## My process
For this challenge, I began by carefully reviewing the project brief to understand the layout and requirements. I then set up the project structure, creating separate files for HTML, CSS, and assets like the QR code image. Using semantic HTML, I built a clean layout and styled it with a mobile-first approach in CSS, utilizing flexbox for centering and Google Fonts for typography. I focused on consistent spacing, rounded corners, and a simple card design. Once styled, I tested responsiveness across different screen sizes to ensure a good user experience. Finally, I added the required attribution, double-checked the layout, and polished the design to match the original as closely as possible.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts (Outfit)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Through this challenge, I gained more experience in:
- Structuring a simple component layout with semantic HTML.
- Using flexbox to align and center content vertically and horizontally.
- Applying consistent padding, border-radius, and typography styling.

### Continued development
Moving forward, I would like to:
- Add hover effects to links and images.
- Experiment with CSS Grid to see alternate layout approaches.
